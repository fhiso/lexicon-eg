Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, SAP and IBM DB2. A [database](#database.md) is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but different DBMSs can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one DBMS. DBMSs systems are often classified according to the database model that they support; the most popular database systems since the 1980s have all supported the relational model as represented by the SQL language.

This is often referred to as double dating. The need for double dating arose from the transition from an older calendar to a newer one. For example, in "10/21 February 1750/51", the dual day of the month is due to the leap year correction of the Julian calendar by the Gregorian calendar, and the dual year is due to some countries beginning their numbered year on 1 January while others were still using another date.

\[[BG](#BG)\] An Entity is a component of a [Data Model](#data model.md). It represents and abstracts a set of objects from the real world. An Entity is composed of Attributes that define its structure; Attributes are abstractions of properties or characteristics of the real objects. An Entity may be in Relationships with other Entities in the Model.

\[[Gramps](#Gramps)\] The role a person plays in an event. In Gramps an event can be linked to as many people as desired. Each person will play a different role. Event role captures this. Some common roles are predefined, others the user can add by just typing in the appropriate role.


<a name="event type.md"></a>

##event type##

\[[Gramps](#Gramps)\] The general denominator an event belongs to. For instance, a Christian, civil, or Tibetan marriages are all denoted by the event type marriage. See events in Gramps for an overview.


<a name="event.md"></a>

##event##

\[[ODO](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/event) 2014-10-02\] A thing that happens or takes place, especially one of importance.

\[[STEMMA](#STEMMA)\] In everyday life, an event is something that happened at a particular place and time, or over a span of time. The Event [entity](#entity.md), though, represents a date, or range of dates, for which source information exists. See [simple Event](#simple event.md), [protracted Event](#protracted event.md), and [hierarchical Event](#hierarchical event.md).

\[[Gramps](#Gramps)\] A defining moment in a person's life. See events for the use in genealogy, for predefined events in Gramps and suggested naming for common events.

\[[BG](#BG)\] An Event is something that happens in the real world at one or more places and at a time or over a period of time. Events of genealogical significance usually involve Persons who often play specific roles with respect to the Event. Some Events, such as birth or marriage, establish Relationships between Persons. Some genealogical Models include Events as an Entity, some include them as Attributes of the Person or other Entities, and some include them both ways. Analogous to Models, the computer representations of Events can be as separate Records or as Field within Records.

\[[GEDCOM-X](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#events-vs-facts) 2014-10-23\] An occurrence that happened at a specific time or period of time, often at a specific place or set of places. Genealogically relevant events are often described by referencing the persons that played a role in that event. Hence events often refer to persons and might infer relationships, but events are described independently of those persons and relationships. See also [fact](#fact.md).


<a name="eventa.md"></a>

##eventa##

\[[BetterGEDCOM](http://bettergedcom.wikispaces.com/share/view/50008096) 2014-10-02\] A description of some event from one specific information source, and with no interpretation; named in acknowledgement of the related [persona](#persona.md) concept.

Its schemata separates a [source](#source.md) from both the [information](#information.md) contained within the source and the [evidence](#evidence.md) that one draws from the information. Developed by Elizabeth Shown Mills for the National Genealogical Society, it is also followed by BCG and MGP.


<a name="evidence and conclusion model.md"></a>

##evidence and conclusion model##

\[[BG](#BG)\] Linked to the [Evidence and Conclusion Process](#evidence and conclusion process.md), but not the same thing. During the *Evidence and Conclusion Process*, the researcher may (in best practice, *should*) document the individual steps. Many people will document their selected evidence, analyses and conclusions as text. When using an Evidence and Conclusion Model, the evidence and conclusions (at least) are formally documented in machine readable form. Specifically, a Source record normally contains details of the source's contents as free-format text or as an image. When working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model, someone's name and age (e.g.) are extracted from that text or image and entered into name and age data items unique to that piece of evidence. This is the Evidence part.

The output from the analysis stage is similarly documented in data items unique to that analysis. This output is identical in format to that from a Conclusion-only Model. Working to a [Conclusion-only Model](#conclusion-only model) *tends* to minimise the number of conclusions for an item, e.g. just one Birth event is usually recorded for an individual. Working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model will result in as many Birth Events per real-life person as there have been analyses. As a result, working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model will show more intermediate steps than otherwise.


<a name="evidence and conclusion process.md"></a>

##evidence and conclusion process##

\[[BG](#BG)\] This process is intended to describe the steps genealogical researchers go through. It may be carried out formally, invoking the [Genealogical Proof Standard](#Genealogical Proof Standard.md), for instance, or informally. In summary, it involves setting a research objective; looking for evidence to support or deny the objective; analysing the evidence and coming to a stated conclusion. Throughout the process, the researcher should review the current results and may loop back to re-start at a previous step — even altering the objective if it appears valueless.


<a name="evidence books.md"></a>

##evidence books##

\[[EE](#EE)\]  Record books maintained by some courts in which clerks have transcribed the evidence presented in cases before that court.

An Evidence Person is created in the same format as a real life person would be under the [Conclusion-only Model](#conclusion-only model.md) but contains only the data known at that time and will not be updated later. The lowest level of Evidence Person contains data extracted from a *single* source record.


<a name="evidence.md"></a>

\[[EE](#EE)\]  A presumed reality—an event, circumstance, or other detail that is considered to have happened or to be true. In historical research, it is difficult to establish *actual* truths; therefore, the validity of any stated “fact” rests upon the quality of the evidence presented to support it.

\[[BG](#BG)\] An item of information. In a [Model](#data model.md) the Attribute Values of [Entity](#entity.md) instances are Facts, and the existence of the Entity instances themselves are Facts. In computer representations Records and Fields are Facts. Basically everything is a Fact, so the term is not useful in distinguishing any one thing from any other.

\[[GEDCOM-X](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#events-vs-facts) 2014-10-23\] A data item that is presumed to be true about a specific subject, such as a person or relationship.

Merriam-Webster defines “hypothesis” in two ways: an assumption or concession made for the sake of argument [and] taken as the ground for action; and a tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical or empirical consequences. 

Hypotheses allow us to evaluate our level of understanding. When the evidence seems to point toward a logical conclusion ... we reevaluate our evidence, trying to disprove our interpretation as intensely as we have tried to prove it. In this process, we go back to the information we have gleaned. We often go back to our sources, as well. We put ourselves into the mental framework of our critics and pick apart our own reasoning. We argue with each piece of information we have found and each deduction we have made. We try to link details in different combinations, in an effort to see them in a different light. We study the work of others who write on similar subjects, applying their perspectives to our conundrum. Often this process suggests new research paths to pursue and new sources to consult. Not until we feel that our conclusion can withstand all critical analyses, should we propose our interpretation as likely proof.

<a name="metadata.md"></a>

##metadata##

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) 2014-10-05\] "data about data". The term is ambiguous, as it is used for two fundamentally different concepts (types). *Structural metadata* is about the design and specification of data structures and is more properly called "data about the containers of data"; *descriptive metadata*, on the other hand, is about individual instances of application data, the data content. The main purpose of metadata is to facilitate in the discovery of relevant information, more often classified as resource discovery. Metadata also helps organize electronic resources, provide digital identification, and helps support archiving and preservation of the resource. Metadata assists in resource discovery by "allowing resources to be found by relevant criteria, identifying resources, bringing similar resources together, distinguishing dissimilar resources, and giving location information".

\[[BG](#BG)\] Usually summarised as "data about data". For instance, (to take a non-genealogical example that I hope still applies), the metadata about a railway wagon number on American railroads tells us that it is up to ten characters long, consisting of a group of up to four letters followed by a group of up to six numbers. It also tells us something about the meaning of those letters (usually ownership). Knowing the metadata helps a programmer write basic validation on input and understand at least some of what the data means. Much of the GEDCOM standard consists of metadata describing how big data items can be, what they mean, what they relate to, etc.

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) 2014-10-07\] A NoSQL (often interpreted as Not Only SQL) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling and finer control over availability. The data structure (e.g. key-value, graph, or document) differs from the RDBMS, and therefore some operations are faster in NoSQL and some in RDBMS. There are differences though, and the particular suitability of a given NoSQL DB depends on the problem it must solve.

<a name="persona.md"></a>

##persona (pl. personae)##

\[[BG](#BG)\] **(1)** - A term for an entity in the GENTECH Data Model. The GENTECH definition is abstracted below:

Definition: Contains the core identification for each individual in genealogical data, and allows information about similarly named or identically named people to be brought together, after suitable analysis, in the same aggregate individual. Because real human beings leave data tracks through time as if they were disparate shadow personas, this entity allows the genealogical researcher to tie together data from different personas that he or she believes belong to the same real person. The mechanism for this, discussed in the text, is to make different PERSONAs part of the same GROUP.

Relationships: One PERSONA is based on one ASSERTION. However, note that an ASSERTION may link one PERSONA to a GROUP, and thus many separate PERSONAs can be brought together into a higher level constructed PERSONA.

*Definition* and *Relationships* taken fom: *GENTECH Genealogical Data Model, version 1.1, 29 May 2000, page 60*.

Commentary - Note there is NO Person entity in the GENTECH Data Model, and a higher level PERSONA may be constructed from several on a lower level - their data is combined to form the information about the higher level Persona. It is unclear to the author why the term Persona is used in the GENTECH Data Model as the entity appears to have all the obvious characteristics of a Person entity.

**(2)** - A term for an entity in the new FamilySearch ("nFS") Data Model.

A Persona entity appears to be intended to represent the data extracted from one source about one human being. Their Person (not Persona) entity appears to be intended to represent the sum of the current conclusions about one human being. A Person takes its information from one or more Personas. newFamilySearch uses a two-level data model so Persons are only made up of Personas, which are derived only from sources.

Personal Commentary
 * There appears to be nothing in nFS that mandates a source record exists in nFS for the Persona.
 * As indicated above, this is a 2-level model only, so there is no opportunity to combine 2 Personas into a new entity and then to combine that new entity with a 3rd one to create a Person. The Person must be a combination of 3 Personas all at once.
 * The nFS users never see the term "persona" on-screen - they only enter and combine people. Personas are therefore hidden from the user.
 * I do not have access to nFS documentation about their data model. This text represents people's deductions about that model from the use of nFS.

See Discussion [Differences from FS Personas?](http://bettergedcom.wikispaces.com/message/view/Defining+E%26C+for+BetterGEDCOM/37800364) and [The Evidence Architecture of the New FamilySearch Tree](http://ancestryinsider.blogspot.com/2010/06/evidence-architecture-of-new.html).

\[[STEMMA](#STEMMA)\] A description of some person from one specific information source, and with no interpretation. Origin is uncertain but there is some history in [Genealogical Persona Non Grata](http://parallax-viewpoint.blogspot.com/2013/09/genealogical-persona-non-grata.html).


<a name="personal name.md"></a>

##personal name##

\[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name) 2014-10-05\] A person's full nomenclature, also known as a *personal name* or *full name*, refers to a set of names by which an individual may be known, that are or can be recited as a group, with the understanding that they all relate to one person. In some cultures, individuals are known by a single name; in others they may possess a variety of names, some of which are specific to the individual and distinguish that person from other relatives, while others indicate the person's relationship to others, or membership in a family, clan, or other social structure.

\[[BG](#BG)\] The words by which a Person is known or referred to. In some genealogical Models a Name is an Attribute of a Person Entity. In some computer representations a Name is a Field of a Person Record. The computer representation of a Name's value is typically restricted with rules about length, character set, and overall formatting.

<a name="place hierarchy.md"></a>

##place hierarchy##

\[[STEMMA](#STEMMA)\] A description of a [place](#place.md) in which each component of the reference is linked to a parent *place* with a broader context, e.g. house to street, to town, to county, to state, to country. See [A Place for Everything](http://parallax-viewpoint.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-place-for-everything.html).

\[[BG](#BG)\] A place may be located within other higher level places covering larger areas, which may themselves be located in even higher level places, forming a hierarchy. The highest level in the hierarchy is often a country, and the lowest for example a farm. A place may be a member of several hierarchies, often defined by different organizations in public administration. Hierarchies may change over time, e.g. when a local place is included in another country, but the local place does per definition stay the same. Place Hierarchies may be represented in data models, databases and files.

##place name hierarchy##

See also [Place Hierarchy Path](#place hierarchy path.md).

\[[BG](#BG)\] A place hierarchy is identified by the names (and optionally types) of the places in the hierarchy during a certain period of time, a Place Name Hierarchy, often found in sources and/or implied by the geographic area covered by the source itself. Place Name Hierarchies can be represented in the current Gedcom by a comma-separated list of names. A hierarchy of names of higher level places provides an additional context for the identification of a place by name, but there could be cases where the hierarchy of names does not identify the higher level context uniquely. Place Name Hierarchies may be represented in data models, databases and files.

##place type##

\[[BG](#BG)\] A classification of a place. Examples of place types are buildings, farms, cities, church parishes, military districts, postal areas, states, countries, continents, oceans etc. The classification may change over time (e.g. a school building changing into a factory), but the type of the highest level places often stay the same. Different terms may be used for a type that essentially means the same classification, possibly using different languages. Place Types may be represented in data models, databases and files.

Some systems use this feature to rank multiple conflicting opinions for display of most likely information first. It is not intended to eliminate the receiver's need to evaluate the evidence for themselves." The specification includes further comment, as below. (Note: These further comments are the subject of much controversy.)
 * 0	Unreliable evidence or estimated data
 * 1	Questionable reliability of evidence (interviews, census, oral genealogies, or potential for bias for example, an autobiography)
 * 2	Secondary evidence, data officially recorded sometime after event
 * 3	Direct and primary evidence used, or by dominance of the evidence

##RDF##

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) 2014-10-04\] The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a family of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications [1] originally designed as a metadata data model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources, using a variety of syntax notations and data serialization formats. It is also used in knowledge management applications. RDF uses [subject–predicate–object](#SVO.md) expressions (or "triples") to represent entity relationships. For instance: (sky)-(has)-(colour blue). This differs from the classical [entity–attribute–value](#EAV.md) OO model which would use (sky)-(colour)-(blue).

Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network (typically the World Wide Web) using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. Subcategories of URIs include [URLs](#URL.md) and [URNs](#URN.md).
