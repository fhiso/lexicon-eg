<p>This Lexicon comprises a set terms &amp; concepts that are currently in use in the genealogical domain by various parties, including its software, researchers, archivists, transcribers, etc. If there are different names for the same thing, or different meanings for the same name, then all would be included together with information about where each definition/usage originated</p>
<p>A &quot;preferred vocabulary&quot; will eventually be needed before FHISO can publish material for external consumption, and ANSI/NISO Z39.19 may be relevant to that end. The interesting thing about a genealogical data standard is that there is no precedent, and hence no obvious place to insert it in the current classification of standards (see ICS). This implicitly means FHISO will need some terms for which there is no standard set or authoritative source.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the goal of the Lexicon is collect together the various terms currently in use, and differentiate them when there are different meanings/nuances, and correlate them when there are different words for the same concept.</p>
<p>To request an addition to this Lexicon, please contact the editors by email at <script type="text/javascript">

<p>[<a href="#BG">BG</a>] During the <a href="#evidence%20and%20conclusion%20process.md">Evidence and Conclusion Process</a>, the researcher may (in best practice, <em>should</em>) document the individual steps. When using a <em>Conclusion-only Model</em>, the researcher will document their selected evidence, analyses and conclusions as text. The conclusions are entered into the application's database, superseding any prior inferior conclusion, so that a person's current data represents the latest, overall working hypothesis derived from all the available evidence. Working to a Conclusion-only Model <em>tends</em> to minimise the number of conclusions for an item, e.g. just one Birth event is <em>usually</em> recorded for an individual. Working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model will result in as many Birth Events per real-life person as there have been analyses.</p>

<p>[<a href="#BG">BG</a>] An Entity is a component of a <a href="#data%20model.md">Data Model</a>. It represents and abstracts a set of objects from the real world. An Entity is composed of Attributes that define its structure; Attributes are abstractions of properties or characteristics of the real objects. An Entity may be in Relationships with other Entities in the Model. When a Model is represented on a computer, a Record is usually defined for each Entity, with Fields that correspond to the Attributes.</p>

<h2 id="epoch">epoch</h2>
<p>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_%28reference_date%29">Wikipedia</a> 2014-10-22] In the fields of chronology and periodization, an epoch is an instant in time chosen as the origin of a particular era. The &quot;epoch&quot; then serves as a reference point from which time is measured. Time measurement units are counted from the epoch so that the date and time of events can be specified unambiguously.</p>

<p>[<a href="#BG">BG</a>] An Event is something that happens in the real world at one or more places and at a time or over a period of time. Events of genealogical significance usually involve Persons who often play specific roles with respect to the Event. Some Events, such as birth or marriage, establish Relationships between Persons. Some genealogical Models include Events as an Entity, some include them as Attributes of the Person or other Entities, and some include them both ways. Analogous to Models, the computer representations of Events can be as separate Records or as Field within Records.</p>
<p>[<a href="https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#events-vs-facts">GEDCOM-X</a> 2014-10-23] An occurrence that happened at a specific time or period of time, often at a specific place or set of places.

<h2 id="evidence-and-conclusion-model">evidence and conclusion model</h2>
<p>[<a href="#BG">BG</a>] Linked to the <a href="#evidence%20and%20conclusion%20process.md">Evidence and Conclusion Process</a>, but not the same thing. During the <em>Evidence and Conclusion Process</em>, the researcher may (in best practice, <em>should</em>) document the individual steps. Many people will document their selected evidence, analyses and conclusions as text. When using an Evidence and Conclusion Model, the evidence and conclusions (at least) are formally documented in machine readable form. Specifically, a Source record normally contains details of the source's contents as free-format text or as an image. When working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model, someone's name and age (e.g.) are extracted from that text or image and entered into name and age data items unique to that piece of evidence. This is the Evidence part.</p>
<p>The output from the analysis stage is similarly documented in data items unique to that analysis. This output is identical in format to that from a Conclusion-only Model. Working to a <a href="#conclusion-only%20model">Conclusion-only Model</a> <em>tends</em> to minimise the number of conclusions for an item, e.g. just one Birth event is usually recorded for an individual. Working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model will result in as many Birth Events per real-life person as there have been analyses. As a result, working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model will show more intermediate steps than otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="evidence-and-conclusion-process">evidence and conclusion process</h2>
<p>[<a href="#BG">BG</a>] This process is intended to describe the steps genealogical researchers go through. It may be carried out formally, invoking the <a href="#Genealogical%20Proof%20Standard.md">Genealogical Proof Standard</a>, for instance, or informally. In summary, it involves setting a research objective; looking for evidence to support or deny the objective; analysing the evidence and coming to a stated conclusion. Throughout the process, the researcher should review the current results and may loop back to re-start at a previous step — even altering the objective if it appears valueless.</p>

Merriam-Webster defines “hypothesis” in two ways: an assumption or concession made for the sake of argument [and] taken as the ground for action; and a tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical or empirical consequences.</p>
<p>Hypotheses allow us to evaluate our level of understanding. When the evidence seems to point toward a logical conclusion ... we reevaluate our evidence, trying to disprove our interpretation as intensely as we have tried to prove it. In this process, we go back to the information we have gleaned. We often go back to our sources, as well. We put ourselves into the mental framework of our critics and pick apart our own reasoning. We argue with each piece of information we have found and each deduction we have made. We try to link details in different combinations, in an effort to see them in a different light. We study the work of others who write on similar subjects, applying their perspectives to our conundrum. Often this process suggests new research paths to pursue and new sources to consult. Not until we feel that our conclusion can withstand all critical analyses, should we propose our interpretation as likely proof.</p>

<h2 id="metadata">metadata</h2>
<p>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">Wikipedia</a> 2014-10-05] &quot;data about data&quot;. The term is ambiguous, as it is used for two fundamentally different concepts (types). <em>Structural metadata</em> is about the design and specification of data structures and is more properly called &quot;data about the containers of data&quot;; <em>descriptive metadata</em>, on the other hand, is about individual instances of application data, the data content. The main purpose of metadata is to facilitate in the discovery of relevant information, more often classified as resource discovery. Metadata also helps organize electronic resources, provide digital identification, and helps support archiving and preservation of the resource. Metadata assists in resource discovery by &quot;allowing resources to be found by relevant criteria, identifying resources, bringing similar resources together, distinguishing dissimilar resources, and giving location information&quot;.</p>
<p>[<a href="#BG">BG</a>] Usually summarised as &quot;data about data&quot;. For instance, (to take a non-genealogical example that I hope still applies), the metadata about a railway wagon number on American railroads tells us that it is up to ten characters long, consisting of a group of up to four letters followed by a group of up to six numbers. It also tells us something about the meaning of those letters (usually ownership). Knowing the metadata helps a programmer write basic validation on input and understand at least some of what the data means. Much of the GEDCOM standard consists of metadata describing how big data items can be, what they mean, what they relate to, etc.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">Wikipedia</a> 2014-10-07] A NoSQL (often interpreted as Not Only SQL) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling and finer control over availability. The data structure (e.g. key-value, graph, or document) differs from the RDBMS, and therefore some operations are faster in NoSQL and some in RDBMS. There are differences though, and the particular suitability of a given NoSQL DB depends on the problem it must solve.</p>

<h2 id="persona-pl.-personae">persona (pl. personae)</h2>
<p>[<a href="#BG">BG</a>] <strong>(1)</strong> - A term for an entity in the GENTECH Data Model. The GENTECH definition is abstracted below:</p>
<p>Definition: Contains the core identification for each individual in genealogical data, and allows information about similarly named or identically named people to be brought together, after suitable analysis, in the same aggregate individual. Because real human beings leave data tracks through time as if they were disparate shadow personas, this entity allows the genealogical researcher to tie together data from different personas that he or she believes belong to the same real person. The mechanism for this, discussed in the text, is to make different PERSONAs part of the same GROUP.</p>
<p>Relationships: One PERSONA is based on one ASSERTION. However, note that an ASSERTION may link one PERSONA to a GROUP, and thus many separate PERSONAs can be brought together into a higher level constructed PERSONA.</p>
<p><em>Definition</em> and <em>Relationships</em> taken fom: <em>GENTECH Genealogical Data Model, version 1.1, 29 May 2000, page 60</em>.</p>
<p>Commentary - Note there is NO Person entity in the GENTECH Data Model, and a higher level PERSONA may be constructed from several on a lower level - their data is combined to form the information about the higher level Persona. It is unclear to the author why the term Persona is used in the GENTECH Data Model as the entity appears to have all the obvious characteristics of a Person entity.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> - A term for an entity in the new FamilySearch (&quot;nFS&quot;) Data Model.</p>
<p>A Persona entity appears to be intended to represent the data extracted from one source about one human being. Their Person (not Persona) entity appears to be intended to represent the sum of the current conclusions about one human being. A Person takes its information from one or more Personas. newFamilySearch uses a two-level data model so Persons are only made up of Personas, which are derived only from sources.</p>
<p>Personal Commentary * There appears to be nothing in nFS that mandates a source record exists in nFS for the Persona. * As indicated above, this is a 2-level model only, so there is no opportunity to combine 2 Personas into a new entity and then to combine that new entity with a 3rd one to create a Person. The Person must be a combination of 3 Personas all at once. * The nFS users never see the term &quot;persona&quot; on-screen - they only enter and combine people. Personas are therefore hidden from the user. * I do not have access to nFS documentation about their data model. This text represents people's deductions about that model from the use of nFS.</p>

It is also used in knowledge management applications. RDF uses <a href="#SVO.md">subject–predicate–object</a> expressions (or &quot;triples&quot;) to represent entity relationships. For instance: (sky)-(has)-(colour blue). This differs from the classical <a href="#EAV.md">entity–attribute–value</a> OO model which would use (sky)-(colour)-(blue).</p>
