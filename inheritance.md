\[[Wikipedia-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29) 2014-11-04\] (computing) In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object or class, using the same implementation (inheriting from a class) or specifying implementation to maintain the same behavior (realizing an interface; inheriting behavior). It is a mechanism for code reuse and to allow independent extensions of the original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a hierarchy.
