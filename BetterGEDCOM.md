\[[BetterGEDCOM](http://bettergedcom.wikispaces.com/home) 2014-10-05\] A wiki-based project looking at the replacement of the old GEDCOM Standard with an equivalent, but enhanced, portable data format that could serve as a basis for future development of genealogical technology collaboration standards. See the [GOALS](http://bettergedcom.wikispaces.com/GOALS) page for details on the more recent revisions to the objectives of this project.
