##parenthetical reference##

See also [author-date style] (author-date style.md).

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A source citation placed in parentheses within the text of a piece of writing; typically used for scientific-style citations to published works, with the parenthetical reference noting just the surname of the author and the year the work was published, while the text is followed by a [bibliography](bibliography.md) or [source list](source list.md) in which all the referenced sources are fully cited.
