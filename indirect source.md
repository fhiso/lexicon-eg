##indirect source##

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A term some writing guides use for the source from which a source obtained its information. Many careful researchers prefer “[source of the source](source of the source.md)” for this concept. Because *source* and *evidence* are terms frequently confused, *Evidence Explained* follows the school that uses the term *indirect* only with the word *evidence* and not with the term *source*.
