##fonds##

\[[ICA](http://www.ica.org/download.php?id=1687) 2014-11-15\] (archival) The whole of the records, regardless of form or medium, organically created and/or accumulated and used by a particular person, family, or corporate body in the course of that creator's activities and functions.

\[[VA-Gloss](http://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/departments/legislative-services/archives/faqs/glossary.html) 2014-11-15\] (archival) All the records created by a person or organization (as opposed to 'collected by' - see [Collection](colletion.md) during the course of their existence. We rarely have a whole fonds in our custody, but (by convention) we describe the records as if we did. Other archives may describe the same thing as a "collection". Pronounced in the French manner with a silent "d" and "s".
