##d'Aboville System##

\[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_numbering_systems#d.27Aboville_System) 2015-10-26\] Genealogical numvering system using a descending numbering method developed by Jacques d'Aboville in 1940 that is very similar to the Henry System, widely used in France. It can be organized either by generation or not. It differs from the Henry System in that periods are used to separate the generations and no changes in numbering are needed for families with more than nine children. For instance: 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, ... for the first descendant in successive generations.
