##negative evidence##

\[[BCG](SOURCES.md#BCG)\] A type of evidence arising from an absence of a situation or information in extant records where that information might be expected; one of three categories of genealogical *evidence*; compare with [negative search](negative search.md).

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  An inference one can draw from the absence of information that should exist under given circumstances.

\[[EE-QL13](SOURCES.md#EE-QL13)\] An absence of what should happen under a given set of circumstances.

\[[EE-QL17](SOURCES.md#EE-QL17)\] Conclusions or implications that can be drawn from the absence of a situation that should exist given the circumstances. Caution: [negative evidence] (negative evidence.md) is not the same as negative findings. Merely not finding what we hope to find is a routine matter in historical research and one that thoroughness often resolves. Negative evidence, on the other hand, remains negative evidence no matter how much more we find. Negative evidence requires us to understand and consider the implications of what should have occurred under a specific set of circumstances—as with Sherlock Holmes’s famous observation about ‘the sound of the dog not barking’ amid a burglary.

\[[MGP](SOURCES.md#MGP)\] A type of evidence arising from an absence of information in extant records where that information might be expected; one of three categories of genealogical *evidence*; compare with [negative search](negative search.md).
