\[[STEMMA](SOURCES.md#STEMMA)\] Originally a [BI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence) process where selecting a summarised datum or a hierarchical field — usually with a click in a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) tool — revealed the underlying data from which it was derived. The term was used routinely during the early 1990s when a new breed of data-driven [OLAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing) product began to emerge. Used in STEMMA to describe the process of “opening” a conclusion to see the supporting evidence (including any proof argument), the raw information that was used as evidence, and eventually to the underlying source.
