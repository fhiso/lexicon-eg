##evidence and conclusion model##

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] Linked to the [Evidence and Conclusion Process](evidence and conclusion process.md), but not the same thing. During the *Evidence and Conclusion Process*, the researcher may (in best practice, *should*) document the individual steps. Many people will document their selected evidence, analyses and conclusions as text. When using an Evidence and Conclusion Model, the evidence and conclusions (at least) are formally documented in machine readable form. Specifically, a Source record normally contains details of the source's contents as free-format text or as an image. When working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model, someone's name and age (e.g.) are extracted from that text or image and entered into name and age data items unique to that piece of evidence. This is the Evidence part.

The output from the analysis stage is similarly documented in data items unique to that analysis. This output is identical in format to that from a Conclusion-only Model. Working to a [Conclusion-only Model](conclusion-only model) *tends* to minimise the number of conclusions for an item, e.g. just one Birth event is usually recorded for an individual. Working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model will result in as many Birth Events per real-life person as there have been analyses. As a result, working to an Evidence and Conclusion Model will show more intermediate steps than otherwise.
