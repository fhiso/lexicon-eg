\[[EE 3rd ed.](SOURCES.md#EE)\] (sec. 1.23) A research tool--finding aids or data summaries compiled from a larger body of materials. Databases that offer digital images are a hybrid whose nature we should clarify in our research. \[Lexicon editorial note: databases can store more than text, such as images, XML documents, and BLOBs (*binary large objects*). The established use of the term in discussing sources and citations implies textual extracts compiled into an indexed form. The source form "database with images" is now used to cover this eventuality\].
