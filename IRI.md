##IRI##

\[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_resource_identifier) 2016-03-05\] Defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 2005 as a new internet standard to extend upon the existing uniform resource identifier ([URI](URI.md)) scheme. The new standard was published in RFC 3987. While URIs are limited to a subset of the ASCII character set, IRIs may contain characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646), including Chinese or Japanese kanji, Korean, Cyrillic characters, and so forth. It is defined by RFC 3987. IRI extend upon URIs by using the Universal Character Set whereas [URIs](URI.md) were limited to the ASCII with far fewer characters. IRIs may be represented by a sequence of octets but by definition is defined as a sequence of characters because IRIs can be spoken or written by hand.
