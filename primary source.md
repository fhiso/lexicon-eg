##primary source##

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A traditional concept within the humanities that is variously defined as an original record, a contemporary account, or a firsthand account, but not necessarily all three simultaneously. The term is no longer used in sound genealogical analysis because any source (and any statement within a source) can be a combination of both firsthand and secondhand information. For the Research Process Map by which genealogists classify sources, see the endpapers of this book.
