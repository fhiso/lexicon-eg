##CURIE##

\[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE) 2016-03-05\] In computing, a CURIE (or Compact [URI](URI.md)) defines a generic, abbreviated syntax for expressing Uniform Resource Identifiers ([URIs](URI.md)). It is an abbreviated [URI](URI.md) expressed in a compact syntax, and may be found in both XML and non-XML grammars. A CURIE may be considered a datatype. An example of CURIE syntax: [isbn:0393315703]. The square brackets may be used to prevent ambiguities between CURIEs and regular [URIs](URI.md), yielding so-called safe CURIEs. [QNames](QName.md) (the namespace prefixes used in XML) often are used as a CURIE, and may be considered a type of CURIE. CURIEs, as defined by the W3C, will be better defined and may include checking. Unlike QNames, the part of a CURIE after the colon does not need to conform to the rules for XML element names. The first W3C Working Draft of CURIE syntax was released 7 March 2007. The final recommendation was released 16 January 2009.

\[[W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) 2016-03-05\] A generic, abbreviated syntax for expressing [URIs](URI.md). This syntax is intended to be used as a common element by language designers. Target languages include, but are not limited to, [XML](XML.md) languages.
