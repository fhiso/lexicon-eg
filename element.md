##element##

\[[STEMMA](SOURCES.md#STEMMA)\] A logical part of a STEMMA [document](document.md). A Document is effectively a tree of nested [elements](element.md). This definition is in keeping with the XML interpretation, although technically distinct.

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) 2014-10-23\] (XML context) A logical document component which either begins with a [start-tag](tag.md) and ends with a matching [end-tag](tag.md) or consists only of an empty-element tag. The characters between the start- and end-tags, if any, are the element's content, and may contain markup, including other elements, which are called child elements. An example of an element is \<Greeting\>Hello, world.\</Greeting\> (see hello world). Another is \<line-break /\>.
