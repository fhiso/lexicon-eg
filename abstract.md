\[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29#Levels_of_abstraction) 2014-11-03\] (computing) At a higher Computer science commonly presents levels (or, less commonly, layers) of abstraction, wherein each level represents a different model of the same information and processes, but uses a system of expression involving a unique set of objects and compositions that apply only to a particular domain. Each relatively abstract, "higher" level builds on a relatively concrete, "lower" level, which tends to provide an increasingly "granular" representation.
