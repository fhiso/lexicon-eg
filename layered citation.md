##layered citation##

\[[EE-QL19] (SOURCES.md#EE-QL19)\] A form of [citation](citation.md) needed when a source has been processed through multiple media, thereby complicating its description and statement of provenance; separate layers identify the imaged record (when an image is provided), the film or digital publication that provides the image or extracted data, the provider's own identification of its source, and (when needed) comments on the source's quality or other relevant issues.

\[[STEMMA](SOURCES.md#STEMMA)\] A form of [citation](citation.md) used to describe the different derivative states of a consulted source through to its original form; usually separated by semicolons. May also include analytical notes.
