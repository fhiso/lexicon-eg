##Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS)##

\[[BCG](SOURCES.md#BCG)\] The genealogy field's standard for determining whether a conclusion is acceptable or not. 
\[[BCG](http://www.bcgcertification.org/resources/standard.html)] Under this standard, genealogical conclusions are expected to demonstrate five criteria:
1. Reasonably exhaustive research;
2. Complete and accurate citation of sources;
3. Analysis and correlation of the collected information;
4. A resolution of conflicting evidence;
5. A soundly reasoned, coherently written conclusion.

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\] Section 1.5: The standard of proof set by genealogy’s scholars and professionals, which poses five conditions that a valid conclusion must meet: thorough research; complete and accurate citation of sources; skilled analysis and correlation of data; resolution of any conflicts in the evidence; a soundly reasoned, written conclusion that details all the evidence, analyses, and documentation—i.e., a [proof argument] (proof-argument.md).

\[[MGP](SOURCES.md#MGP)\] The genealogy field’s standard for differentiating 	acceptable from unacceptable conclusions.
