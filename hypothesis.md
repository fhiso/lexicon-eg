##hypothesis##

\[[BCG](SOURCES.md#BCG)\] Evidence or potential conclusions subjected to tests of accuracy; see [evidence](evidence.md) and [conclusion](conclusion.md).

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A proposition based upon an analysis of evidence at hand; not a conclusion but a premise to focus research more narrowly in an effort to prove or disprove a point.

\[[EE-QL16](SOURCES.md#EE-QL16)\] A variable point between speculation and understanding. Merriam-Webster defines “hypothesis” in two ways: an assumption or concession made for the sake of argument [and] taken as the ground for action; and a tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical or empirical consequences. 

Hypotheses allow us to evaluate our level of understanding. When the evidence seems to point toward a logical conclusion ... we reevaluate our evidence, trying to disprove our interpretation as intensely as we have tried to prove it. In this process, we go back to the information we have gleaned. We often go back to our sources, as well. We put ourselves into the mental framework of our critics and pick apart our own reasoning. We argue with each piece of information we have found and each deduction we have made. We try to link details in different combinations, in an effort to see them in a different light. We study the work of others who write on similar subjects, applying their perspectives to our conundrum. Often this process suggests new research paths to pursue and new sources to consult. Not until we feel that our conclusion can withstand all critical analyses, should we propose our interpretation as likely proof.

\[[MGP](SOURCES.md#MGP)\] Evidence or a potential conclusion subjected to tests of accuracy; see [evidence](evidence.md) and [conclusion](conclusion.md).
