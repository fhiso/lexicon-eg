##related information##

See also [related sources] (related sources.md)

\[[BCG](SOURCES.md#BCG)\] Information items that can be traced to one informant, source, or origin; therefore items that duplicate, rather than reinforce, each other; sometimes called "related sources"; the opposite of [independent sources](independent sources.md).
