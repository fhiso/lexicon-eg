##supra##

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A Latin term meaning *above.* In source citations, the word follows a shortened title and is used to refer generically to the place in which the full particulars have been given; now considered pass√©. *Previously cited* is commonly used in its stead, today, when a notation of that sort is essential.
