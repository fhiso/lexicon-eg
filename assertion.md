\[[GenTech](SOURCES.md#GenTech)\] A programmatic statement of something being true (or untrue) that was derived from a source fragment or the result of prior assertions.

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] A claim or a statement of fact. The fact might be the existence of a Person or the truth of a name Attribute; some claims may be justified with evidence. In some Models an Assertion is an Entity, and its computer representations are with Assertion Records. In other Models an Assertion is a Relationship between an Entity with the fact and possibly an Entity with the Evidence. Computer representations based on these models implement Assertions as References between Records.
