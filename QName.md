##QNameE##

\[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QName) 2016-03-05\] Introduced by [XML](XML.md) Namespaces in order to be used as [URI](URI.md) references. QName stands for "qualified name" and defines a valid identifier for elements and attributes. QNames are generally used to reference particular elements or attributes within [XML](XML.md) documents. Since [URI](URI.md) references can be long and may contain prohibited characters for element/attribute naming, QNames are used to create a mapping between the [URI](URI.md) and a namespace prefix. The mapping enables the abbreviation of [URIs](URI.md), therefore it achieves a more convenient way to write [XML](XML.md) documents.
