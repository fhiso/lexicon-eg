##persona (pl. personae)##

\[[BG](SOURCES.md#BG)\] **(1)** - A term for an entity in the GENTECH Data Model. The GENTECH definition is abstracted below:

Definition: Contains the core identification for each individual in genealogical data, and allows information about similarly named or identically named people to be brought together, after suitable analysis, in the same aggregate individual. Because real human beings leave data tracks through time as if they were disparate shadow personas, this entity allows the genealogical researcher to tie together data from different personas that he or she believes belong to the same real person. The mechanism for this, discussed in the text, is to make different PERSONAs part of the same GROUP.

Relationships: One PERSONA is based on one ASSERTION. However, note that an ASSERTION may link one PERSONA to a GROUP, and thus many separate PERSONAs can be brought together into a higher level constructed PERSONA.

*Definition* and *Relationships* taken fom: *GENTECH Genealogical Data Model, version 1.1, 29 May 2000, page 60*.

Commentary - Note there is NO Person entity in the GENTECH Data Model, and a higher level PERSONA may be constructed from several on a lower level - their data is combined to form the information about the higher level Persona. It is unclear to the author why the term Persona is used in the GENTECH Data Model as the entity appears to have all the obvious characteristics of a Person entity.

**(2)** - A term for an entity in the new FamilySearch ("nFS") Data Model.

A Persona entity appears to be intended to represent the data extracted from one source about one human being. Their Person (not Persona) entity appears to be intended to represent the sum of the current conclusions about one human being. A Person takes its information from one or more Personas. newFamilySearch uses a two-level data model so Persons are only made up of Personas, which are derived only from sources.

Personal Commentary
 * There appears to be nothing in nFS that mandates a source record exists in nFS for the Persona.
 * As indicated above, this is a 2-level model only, so there is no opportunity to combine 2 Personas into a new entity and then to combine that new entity with a 3rd one to create a Person. The Person must be a combination of 3 Personas all at once.
 * The nFS users never see the term "persona" on-screen - they only enter and combine people. Personas are therefore hidden from the user.
 * I do not have access to nFS documentation about their data model. This text represents people's deductions about that model from the use of nFS.

\[[STEMMA](SOURCES.md#STEMMA)\] A description of some person from one specific information source, and with no interpretation. Origin is uncertain but there is some history in [Genealogical Persona Non Grata](http://parallax-viewpoint.blogspot.com/2013/09/genealogical-persona-non-grata.html).

\[EE](https://www.evidenceexplained.com/quicktips/proving-identity) 2014-12-05\] PERSONA is the composite we create by reconstructing the full course of a human life, by considering all the elements that make this person unique, and by thoroughly researching other same-name people of the place and time to sort them correctly.
