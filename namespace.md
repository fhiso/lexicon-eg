##namespace##

\[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) 2016-03-23\] (a) "In computing, a namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organize objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name". (b) "A namespace in computer science (...), is an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols" -- Wikipedia appears to be contradictory, defining a namespace as both the set of symbols and the container that keeps them apart from others.

\[[STEMMA](SOURCES.md#STEMMA)\] A container for a set of names or other identifiers. Each namespace typically has an identifier of its own unless it is the default one.
