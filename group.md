\[[STEMMA](SOURCES.md#STEMMA)\] A STEMMA [entity](entity.md) representing an organised real-world entity, such as a regiment, organisation, or school/class.  Individual [subject entities](subject entities.md) — currently only [Persons](person.md) and *Animals* — may be associated with a *Group* over given spans of time. It may, therefore, be used to model different interpretations of a family unit.
