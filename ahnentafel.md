\[[BCG](SOURCES.md#BCG)\] A genealogical numbering system in which a compiler assigns number *1* to a subject, *2* to the subject's father, *3* to the subject's mother, and continues by using double each person's number for that person's father and double the person's number plus *1* for that person's mother.

\[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogical_numbering_systems#Ahnentafel) 2015-10-26\] Also known as the Eytzinger Method, Sosa Method, and Sosa-Stradonitz Method, allows for the numbering of ancestors beginning with a descendant. This system allows one to derive an ancestor's number without compiling the list and allows one to derive an ancestor's relationship based on their number. The number of a person's father is the double of their own number, and the number of a person's mother is the double of their own, plus one. For instance, if the number of John Smith is 10, his father is 20, and his mother is 21.
