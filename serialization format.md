##serialization format (UK: serialisation format)##

\[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization#Serialization_formats) 2014-10-02\] The representation of a data structure when "flattened" into a sequence of bytes, either for storage on disk, representation in a memory buffer, or transmission over a communications protocol. The term is a superset of the more traditional *file format* that equally applies to those other circumstances.
