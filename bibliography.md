##bibliography##

\[[EE](SOURCES.md#EE)\]  A list of sources relevant to the subject at hand, citing each source in full. An *annotated* bibliography is one that discusses the sources in addition to providing full citations. A bibliography typically does not cite individual manuscripts or documents; rather, it cites a collection or series in which the manuscript appears. Also see [source list](source list.md).
