##interpretation##
\[[EE-QL16](SOURCES.md#EE-QL16)\]  (Merriam-Webster) interpret: to explain or tell the meaning of or present in understandable terms; to perform … in a way that conveys one’s understanding of the creator’s ideas. The key concept in both definitions of “interpret” is understanding. This means a thorough knowledge of our subject and the context of the place and time. As students of history, we arrive at that kind of knowledge, that understanding, by working our way through all those building blocks of proof.
